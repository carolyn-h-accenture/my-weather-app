# Day 1 Objectives 
Review the MyWeather App Requirements document and then work in your assigned team to begin building your application:
1.	Determine how you will work together with your team. 
•	Clone your team’s repository. Have one member of your team create an Angular application using Angular CLI.  Push this to your team’s repository and ensure that everyone can pull and push the changes.
2.	Review the MyWeather App Evaluation Criteria. At the end of the course, your code will be evaluated against these criteria. 
3.	Create your first module and component:
•	Based on the screens in the requirements, design components and make it live using HTML5 and CSS3 (or SASS).
•	Examine the data you can retrieve from the online weather API. Copy the data for at least 5 cities to use as you begin to develop your app.
•	For now, hard code an array of data in the list component. Pass the information for one city to each child component displaying textual information.
4.	Post your code to the Innersource Repository for review (with the specific project name provided by your instructor).


# Day 1 -  Selected Best Practices  

Code has been structured such a way that it can be expanded to a large solution 

Separation of concerns i.e. 'assets' folder has images contents

Scaffolding was done for testing using karma, setup enviornment, proper routing, and modules 

# MyWeatherApp Sample Code

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.2.

## Development server
Navigate to the cloned folder for day-1: my-weather-app

Run `npm install` to install all the required package

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
